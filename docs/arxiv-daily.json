In contrast to data-driven approaches such as dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), which approximate the Koopman operator without a clear connection to differential operators, the proposed method constructs finite-dimensional Koopman matrices by projecting the dynamics onto a Chebyshev basis, thereby capturing both differential and nonlinear terms. This establishes a numerical link between the Koopman and differential operators. Numerical experiments on benchmark dynamical systems confirm the accuracy and efficiency of the approach, underscoring its potential for interpretable operator learning.

Yet, the theoretical foundations underpinning this progress in control remain underdeveloped. This paper investigates the theoretical structure and connections between two extensions of Koopman theory to control: (i) Koopman operator via infinite input sequences and (ii) the Koopman control family. Although these frameworks encode system information in fundamentally different ways, we show that under certain conditions on the function spaces they operate on, they are equivalent. The equivalence is both in terms of the actions of the Koopman-based formulations in each framework as well as the function values on the system trajectories.

However, its infinite-dimensional nature makes identifying suitable finite-dimensional subspaces challenging, especially for deep architectures. We argue that these difficulties come from suboptimal representation learning, where latent variables fail to balance expressivity and simplicity. This tension is closely related to the information bottleneck (IB) dilemma: constructing compressed representations that are both compact and predictive. Rethinking Koopman learning through this lens, we demonstrate that latent mutual information promotes simplicity, yet an overemphasis on simplicity may cause latent space to collapse onto a few dominant modes. In contrast, expressiveness is sustained by the von Neumann entropy, which prevents such collapse and encourages mode diversity. This insight leads us to propose an information-theoretic Lagrangian formulation that explicitly balances this tradeoff. Furthermore, we propose a new algorithm based on the Lagrangian formulation that encourages both simplicity and expressiveness, leading to a stable and interpretable Koopman representation. Beyond quantitative evaluations, we further visualize the learned manifolds under our representations, observing empirical results consistent with our theoretical predictions. Finally, we validate our approach across a diverse range of dynamical systems, demonstrating improved performance over existing Koopman learning methods.

While recent one-step methods accelerate inference by learning direct noise-to-image mappings, they sacrifice the interpretability and fine-grained control intrinsic to diffusion dynamics, key advantages that enable applications like editable generation. To resolve this dichotomy, we introduce \\textbf{Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion}, a novel framework that achieves both one-step sampling and interpretable generative trajectories. Grounded in Koopman operator theory, our method lifts the nonlinear diffusion dynamics into a latent space where evolution is governed by globally linear operators, enabling closed-form trajectory solutions. This formulation not only eliminates iterative sampling but also provides full access to intermediate states, allowing manual intervention during generation. To model the multi-scale nature of images, we design a hierarchical architecture that disentangles generative dynamics across spatial resolutions via scale-specific Koopman subspaces, capturing coarse-to-fine details systematically. We empirically show that the Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion not only achieves competitive one-step generation performance but also provides a principled mechanism for interpreting and manipulating the generative process through spectral analysis. Our framework bridges the gap between fast sampling and interpretability in diffusion models, paving the way for explainable image synthesis in generative modeling.|\n", "2510.09082": "|**2025-10-10**|**Physics-Informed High-order Graph Dynamics Identification Learning for Predicting Complex Networks Long-term Dynamics**|Yibo Xue|cs.AI; cs.CY; cs.SI; physics.soc-ph|[2510.09082](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09082)||Learning complex network dynamics is fundamental to understanding, modelling and controlling real-world complex systems. There are two main problems in the task of predicting the dynamic evolution of complex networks: on the one hand, existing methods usually use simple graphs to describe the relationships in complex networks; however, this approach can only capture pairwise relationships, while there may be rich non-pairwise structured relationships in the network. First-order GNNs have difficulty in capturing dynamic non-pairwise relationships. On the other hand, theoretical prediction models lack accuracy and data-driven prediction models lack interpretability. To address the above problems, this paper proposes a higher-order network dynamics identification method for long-term dynamic prediction of complex networks. Firstly, to address the problem that traditional graph machine learning can only deal with pairwise relations, dynamic hypergraph learning is introduced to capture the higher-order non-pairwise relations among complex networks and improve the accuracy of complex network modelling. Then, a dual-driven dynamic prediction module for physical data is proposed. The Koopman operator theory is introduced to transform the nonlinear dynamical differential equations for the dynamic evolution of complex networks into linear systems for solving. Meanwhile, the physical information neural differential equation method is utilised to ensure that the dynamic evolution conforms to the physical laws. The dual-drive dynamic prediction module ensures both accuracy and interpretability of the prediction.

With this choice, the Koopman operator of the closed-loop system is a bilinear combination of the coefficients in two matrices: one representing the system, and the other the controller.

Analytically, we study a universal quantum regression model and demonstrate that relatively uniform Pauli channels suppress gradient magnitudes and reduce expressivity, making optimisation more difficult. Conversely, asymmetric noise such as amplitude damping or biased Pauli channels introduces directional bias that can be exploited during optimisation.

Traditional Fourier-based methods often fail to reliably identify closely spaced modes or accurately capture modal interactions and complexities. To address these limitations, we propose a methodology leveraging the enhanced time -frequency resolution capabilities of the continuous wavelet transform (CWT). By selecting appropriate harmonic regions within the wavelet spectra, we effectively isolate modes, and then invert them back in the temporal domain by applying the inverse CWT (ICWT). In this way we reconstruct the corresponding modal dynamics in the time domain. Using the Hilbert transform, instantaneous phases are extracted for each identified mode, enabling the introduction of a complexified modal matrix which robustly characterizes the system's modal properties, even under challenging perturbations such as noise and uncertainties due to modal interference and unmodeled effects. The identified modal parameters are utilized to reconstruct the frequency response functions (FRFs) of the system and to develop a reduced-order model (ROM) that captures accurately the system's dominant dynamical behavior valid in a specified frequency range.. Validation of the methodology is conducted both with a numerical non-classical damping and an experimental testbed representing a model of an airplane structure.

We constrain the contribution of the precessional instability to tidal dissipation and heat transport, using Cartesian hydrodynamical simulations in a small patch of a planet, and study its interaction with turbulent convection, modelled as rotating Rayleigh-B\\'{e}nard convection. The precessional instability without convection results in laminar flow at low values and turbulent flow at sufficiently high values of $\\mathrm{Po}$. The associated tidal dissipation rate scales as $\\mathrm{Po}^2$ and $\\mathrm{Po}^3$ in each regime, respectively. With convection, the Poincar\\'e number at which turbulent flow is achieved shifts to lower values for stronger convective driving. Convective motions also act on large-scale tidal flows like an effective viscosity, resulting in continuous tidal dissipation (scaling as $\\mathrm{Po}^2$), which obfuscates or suppresses tidal dissipation due to precessional instability. The effective viscosities obtained agree with scaling laws previously derived using (rotating) mixing-length theory. By evaluating our scaling laws using interior models of Hot Jupiters, we find that the precessional instability is significantly more efficient than the effective viscosity of convection. The former drives alignment in 1 Gyr for a Jupiter-like planet orbiting within 23 days. Linearly excited inertial waves can be even more effective for wider orbits, aligning spins for orbits within 53-142 days.|\n", "2510.25601": "|**2025-10-29**|**Out-of-equilibrium contributions to charm hadrons in a fluid-dynamic approach**|Silvia Masciocchi|hep-ph; nucl-th|[2510.25601](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25601)|14 pages, 6 figures, GitHub repository at:\n  https://github.com/fafafrens/Fluidum.jl|Building on previous studies that demonstrated the applicability of a fluid-dynamic description of charm quarks in the quark-gluon plasma, the present work extends the framework by computing the out-of-equilibrium contributions to the distribution function of charm hadrons. The analysis includes corrections arising from the initial out-of-equilibrium distribution of charm quarks after a free-streaming phase, as well as from the freeze-out surface within fluid dynamics. These results enable the exact computation of integrated yields and transverse momentum distributions of charm hadrons for different values of the spatial diffusion coefficient, thereby providing the basis for a systematic determination of the charm transport coefficients. In addition, the limits of applicability of the approach are identified by determining the transverse-momentum region in which charm hadrons are described by a well-defined, positive distribution function.|\n", "2510.25586": "|**2025-10-29**|**Rush-to-equilibrium concept for minimizing reactive nitrogen emissions in ammonia combustion**|Michael E. Mueller|physics.flu-dyn|[2510.25586](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25586)|38 pages, 14 figures, pre-print|Ammonia (NH3) is a zero-carbon fuel that has been receiving increasing attention for power generation and even transportation. Compared to H2, NH3's volumetric energy density is higher, is not as explosive, and has well established transport and storage technologies. Yet, NH3 has poor flammability and flame stability characteristics and more reactive nitrogen (RN: NOx, N2O) emissions than hydrocarbon fuels, at least with traditional combustion processes. Partially cracking NH3 (into a NH3-H2-N2 mixture, AHN) addresses its flammability and stability issues. RN emissions remain a challenge, and mechanisms of their emissions are fundamentally different in NH3 and hydrocarbon combustion. While rich-quench-lean NH3 combustion strategies have shown promise, the largest contributions to RN emissions are the unrelaxed emissions in the fuel-rich stage due to overshoot of thermodynamic equilibrium within the reaction zone of premixed flames coupled with finite residence times available for relaxation to equilibrium. This work introduces a rush-to-equilibrium concept for AHN combustion, which aims to reduce the unrelaxed RN emissions in finite residence times by accelerating the approach to equilibrium. In the concept, a flow particle is subjected to a decaying mixing rate as it transits the premixed flame. This mitigates the mixing effects that prevents the particle approach to equilibrium, and promotes the chemistry effects to push the particle toward equilibrium, all while considering finite residence times. Evaluated with a state-of-the-art combustion model at gas turbine conditions, the concept shows the potential to reduce RN emissions by an order of magnitude, and that works irrespective of cracking extent, pressure, temperature, etc. A brief discussion of possible practical implementation reveals reasonable geometric and flow parameters characteristic of modern gas turbine combustors.|\n"}}
